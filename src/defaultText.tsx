As it turns out, I'm not a content generator. I make web stuff. People tell me what should be in the web stuff, but I'm not the one who should have to create it. If it were my job, [this link would describe 95% of my work](https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2018/01/reasons-content-sucks/ "Reasons content sucks"). And, as quoted in that story, this is likely the reason:

If I really wanted to be a content generator, I would have become a writer, or an artist, or any of the dozens of other people who write stuff worth reading/ enjoying, etc. But that's not me, so this rant is all you're getting out of me, FCC!



Now, getting to write code is something completely different. Take, for example, my favorite js trick (that I can think of, anyway) -  \`str.split('').reverse().join('')\` - Now, that's just fun. And it beats the hell out of the following:
\`\`\`
let returnStr;
for(let i=0; i < str.length; i++){
returnStr = str.charAt(i) + returnStr;
}
return returnStr;
\`\`\`

So, I guess my point is that **Web Dev Rocks!**

I mean, what's not to love?
1. You get to solve puzzles
1. You get to make stuff
